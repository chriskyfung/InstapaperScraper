## ✨ Features

- Scrapes all bookmarks from your Instapaper account.
- Supports scraping from specific folders.
- Exports data to CSV, JSON, or a SQLite database.
- Securely stores your session for future runs.
- Modern, modular, and tested architecture.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 1. Requirements

- Python 3.9+

### 📦 2. Installation

This package is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip:

```sh
pip install instapaper-scraper
```

### 💻 3. Usage

Run the tool from the command line, specifying your desired output format:

```sh
# Scrape and export to the default CSV format
instapaper-scraper

# Scrape and export to JSON
instapaper-scraper --format json

# Scrape and export to a SQLite database with a custom name
instapaper-scraper --format sqlite --output my_articles.db
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 🔐 Authentication

The script authenticates using one of the following methods, in order of priority:

1. **Command-line Arguments**: Provide your username and password directly when running the script:

    ```sh
    instapaper-scraper --username your_username --password your_password
    ```

2. **Session Files (`.session_key`, `.instapaper_session`)**: The script attempts to load these files in the following order:
    a.  Path specified by `--session-file` or `--key-file` arguments.
    b.  Files in the current working directory (e.g., `./.session_key`).
    c.  Files in the user's configuration directory (`~/.config/instapaper-scraper/`).
    After the first successful login, the script creates an encrypted `.instapaper_session` file and a `.session_key` file to reuse your session securely.

3. **Interactive Prompt**: If no other method is available, the script will prompt you for your username and password.

> **Note on Security:** Your session file (`.instapaper_session`) and the encryption key (`.session_key`) are stored with secure permissions (read/write for the owner only) to protect your credentials.

### 📁 Folder and Field Configuration

You can define and quickly access your Instapaper folders and set default output fields using a `config.toml` file. The scraper will look for this file in the following locations (in order of precedence):

1. The path specified by the `--config-path` argument.
2. `config.toml` in the current working directory.
3. `~/.config/instapaper-scraper/config.toml`

Here is an example of `config.toml`:

```toml
# Default output filename for non-folder mode
output_filename = "home-articles.csv"

# Optional fields to include in the output.
# These can be overridden by command-line flags.
[fields]
read_url = false
article_preview = false

[[folders]]
key = "ml"
id = "1234567"
slug = "machine-learning"
output_filename = "ml-articles.json"

[[folders]]
key = "python"
id = "7654321"
slug = "python-programming"
output_filename = "python-articles.db"
```

- **output_filename (top-level)**: The default output filename to use when not in folder mode.
- **[fields]**: A section to control which optional data fields are included in the output.
    -   `read_url`: Set to `true` to include the Instapaper read URL for each article.
    -   `article_preview`: Set to `true` to include the article's text preview.
- **[[folders]]**: Each `[[folders]]` block defines a specific folder.
    -   **key**: A short alias for the folder.
    -   **id**: The folder ID from the Instapaper URL.
    -   **slug**: The human-readable part of the folder URL.
    -   **output_filename (folder-specific)**: A preset output filename for scraped articles from this specific folder.

When a `config.toml` file is present and no `--folder` argument is provided, the scraper will prompt you to select a folder. You can also specify a folder directly using the `--folder` argument with its key, ID, or slug. Use `--folder=none` to explicitly disable folder mode and scrape all articles.

### 💻 Command-line Arguments

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--config-path <path>`| Path to the configuration file. Searches `~/.config/instapaper-scraper/config.toml` and `config.toml` in the current directory by default. |
| `--folder <value>` | Specify a folder by key, ID, or slug from your `config.toml`. **Requires a configuration file to be loaded.** Use `none` to explicitly disable folder mode. If a configuration file is not found or fails to load, and this option is used (not set to `none`), the program will exit. |
| `--format <format>` | Output format (`csv`, `json`, `sqlite`). Default: `csv`. |
| `--output <filename>` | Specify a custom output filename. The file extension will be automatically corrected to match the selected format. |
| `--username <user>` | Your Instapaper account username. |
| `--password <pass>` | Your Instapaper account password. |
| `--[no-]read-url` | Includes the Instapaper read URL. (Old flag `--add-instapaper-url` is deprecated but supported). Can be set in `config.toml`. Overrides config. |
| `--[no-]article-preview` | Includes the article preview text. (Old flag `--add-article-preview` is deprecated but supported). Can be set in `config.toml`. Overrides config. |

### 📄 Output Formats

You can control the output format using the `--format` argument. The supported formats are:

- `csv` (default): Exports data to `output/bookmarks.csv`.
- `json`: Exports data to `output/bookmarks.json`.
- `sqlite`: Exports data to an `articles` table in `output/bookmarks.db`.

If the `--format` flag is omitted, the script will default to `csv`.

When using `--output <filename>`, the file extension is automatically corrected to match the chosen format. For example, `instapaper-scraper --format json --output my_articles.txt` will create `my_articles.json`.

#### 📖 Opening Articles in Instapaper

The output data includes a unique `id` for each article. You can use this ID to construct a URL to the article's reader view: `https://www.instapaper.com/read/<article_id>`.

For convenience, you can use the `--read-url` flag to have the script include a full, clickable URL in the output.

```sh
instapaper-scraper --read-url
```

This adds a `instapaper_url` field to each article in the JSON output and a `instapaper_url` column in the CSV and SQLite outputs. The original `id` field is preserved.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The tool is designed with a modular architecture for reliability and maintainability.

1. **Authentication**: The `InstapaperAuthenticator` handles secure login and session management.
2. **Scraping**: The `InstapaperClient` iterates through all pages of your bookmarks, fetching the metadata for each article with robust error handling and retries. Shared constants, like the Instapaper base URL, are managed through `src/instapaper_scraper/constants.py`.
3. **Data Collection**: All fetched articles are aggregated into a single list.
4. **Export**: Finally, the collected data is written to a file in your chosen format (`.csv`, `.json`, or `.db`).

## 📊 Example Output

### 📄 CSV (`output/bookmarks.csv`) (with --add-instapaper-url and --add-article-preview)

```csv
"id","instapaper_url","title","url","article_preview"
"999901234","https://www.instapaper.com/read/999901234","Article 1","https://www.example.com/page-1/","This is a preview of article 1."
"999002345","https://www.instapaper.com/read/999002345","Article 2","https://www.example.com/page-2/","This is a preview of article 2."
```

### 📄 JSON (`output/bookmarks.json`) (with --add-instapaper-url and --add-article-preview)

```json
[
    {
        "id": "999901234",
        "title": "Article 1",
        "url": "https://www.example.com/page-1/",
        "instapaper_url": "https://www.instapaper.com/read/999901234",
        "article_preview": "This is a preview of article 1."
    },
    {
        "id": "999002345",
        "title": "Article 2",
        "url": "https://www.example.com/page-2/",
        "instapaper_url": "https://www.instapaper.com/read/999002345",
        "article_preview": "This is a preview of article 2."
    }
]
```

### 🗄️ SQLite (`output/bookmarks.db`)

A SQLite database file is created with an `articles` table. The table includes `id`, `title`, and `url` columns. If the `--add-instapaper-url` flag is used, a `instapaper_url` column is also included. This feature is fully backward-compatible and will automatically adapt to the user's installed SQLite version, using an efficient generated column on modern versions (3.31.0+) and a fallback for older versions.
