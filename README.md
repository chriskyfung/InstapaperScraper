# Instapaper Scraper

This script allows users to **scrape** all saved Instapaper bookmarks and export them as **CSV data**.

## Features
- Scrapes all bookmarks from your Instapaper home page.
- Support scraping bookmarks from specific Instapaper folders
- Export bookmarks metadata in CSV format

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required:
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `python-dotenv`

Install all dependencies using the provided requirements.txt:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Create an `.env` file in the project root with your credentials:
    ```
    INSTAPAPER_USERNAME=your_username
    INSTAPAPER_PASSWORD=your_password
    ```
3. Run the script:
    ```sh
    # Output to console
    python scrape.py

    # Save output to CSV file
    python scrape.py > bookmarks.csv
    ```

## Environment Variables
- `INSTAPAPER_USERNAME`: Your Instapaper account username
- `INSTAPAPER_PASSWORD`: Your Instapaper account password
- `ENABLE_FOLDER_MODE`: Set to 'true' to scrape a specific folder
- `FOLDER_ID_AND_SLUG`: The folder ID and slug when folder mode is enabled

## How It Works
1. **Authenticate**: Logs into Instapaper using your credentials
2. **Extract Bookmarks**: Fetches bookmarks from either homepage or specific folder
3. **Process Pages**: Iterates through all available pages of bookmarks
4. **Output CSV**: Prints bookmark data in CSV format with headers

## Example Output
The script outputs CSV data with the following structure:

```csv
page,id,title,url
Page 1,999901234,"Article 1",https://www.example.com/page-1/
Page 1,999002345,"Article 2",https://www.example.com/page-2/
```
